# MicrosatAnalysis
A cross platform microsatellite analysis tool.

This project contains the initial building blocks for an analysis program, identifying microsatellite lengths from fluorescently tagged samples. This software:
- Is compatible with ABI formatted files, saved as .fsa.
- Using matplotlib plots the peak positions.
- Exports peak locations to a .csv file.

However this software is not complete and needs both a user interface and further analysis work of the results before being suitable for general use.
